5.	And with that, the UC San Diego chapter of my life is finished 🌊🎓✌🏼 One month ago, I graduated from UCSD and completed my BA in International Business with a minor in Japanese Studies. Thank you to my family and friends who’ve supported me throughout college and all the struggles that came with it. It’s been a long four years, and while it may have not ended in the way that I expected, I’m grateful for everything that has led up to my final quarter. Thank you to everyone who has followed me on this journey and congrats to my friends who also graduated this year 🥰🎉

15.	"Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man." ~ Hayao Miyazaki ✌🏼🌸 #explorejapan

19. A great deal of your decisions are informed by your emotional responses because that is what emotions are designed to do: to appraise and summarize an experience and inform your actions. Hence, emotional intelligence is important in helping you become more aware of these emotional responses so that they don’t control you but rather you control them.
